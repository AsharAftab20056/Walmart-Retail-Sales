# üõí Walmart Retail Sales ‚Äì Time Series Breakdown  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project focuses on **time series analysis of Walmart‚Äôs retail dataset**, with an emphasis on understanding **economic and seasonal factors** (Fuel Price, CPI, Unemployment, Temperature, and MarkDowns). The goal was to uncover **long-term trends, seasonal cycles, and forecast future behavior** using Python-based time series techniques.  

By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience in:  
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Time series trend & seasonality analysis  
- Time series decomposition  
- Rolling averages & smoothing  
- Forecasting with Exponential Smoothing (ETS)  
- Data visualization using Matplotlib

- **Key Columns**:  
  - `Store` ‚Äì Store ID  
  - `Date` ‚Äì Week start date  
  - `IsHoliday` ‚Äì Whether the week was a holiday or not  
  - `Temperature` ‚Äì Regional temperature  
  - `Fuel_Price` ‚Äì Fuel price in the region  
  - `CPI` ‚Äì Consumer Price Index  
  - `Unemployment` ‚Äì Unemployment rate  
  - `MarkDown1‚Äì5` ‚Äì Promotional markdown data

## üìä Steps & Analysis  

### üü¢ Step 1: Data Preprocessing  
- Converted dates into datetime format  
- Handled missing values (`MarkDown` ‚Üí 0, others filled using forward/backward fill)  
- Fixed datatypes (Store as category, IsHoliday as boolean)  
- Created new time features: Year, Month, YearMonth, MonthName  
- Built **TotalMarkDown** feature by combining markdown columns  

### üü¢ Step 2: Trend Analysis  
- Aggregated features to monthly level  
- Observed long-term movements in Fuel Price, CPI, Unemployment, and Temperature  

### üü¢ Step 3: Moving Averages  
- Applied 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month rolling averages  
- Compared smoothed curves against raw data to identify trends  

### üü¢ Step 4: Seasonal Patterns  
- Extracted month names for all records  
- Plotted average values by month across years  
- Found **Temperature** to be highly seasonal, while CPI and Unemployment showed weaker cycles  

### üü¢ Step 5: Time Series Decomposition  
- Used `seasonal_decompose` to separate each variable into:  
  - **Trend** ‚Üí long-term direction  
  - **Seasonality** ‚Üí repeating yearly cycles  
  - **Residuals** ‚Üí random fluctuations  

### üü¢ Step 6: Revenue / MarkDown Breakdown  
- Summed up markdowns to analyze total promotions over time  
- Compared markdown intensity by store and across months  

### üü¢ Step 7 (Bonus): Forecasting  
- Applied **Exponential Smoothing (ETS)**  
- Forecasted next 12 months for selected variables

## üîë Key Insights  
- **Temperature** shows the clearest seasonality (summer peaks, winter dips).  
- **CPI** rises steadily over time (inflation effect).  
- **Unemployment** trends downward, with mild seasonal signals.  
- **Fuel Prices** fluctuate but lack strong seasonality.  
- **Markdowns** are unevenly distributed across stores, highlighting targeted promotions.

## üèÅ Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how **time series analysis** can uncover patterns in retail data and provide **actionable insights**:  

- Seasonality helps align promotions with demand cycles.  
- Trend analysis highlights the impact of economic conditions.  
- Decomposition makes it easier to separate noise from meaningful signals.  
- Simple forecasting (ETS) provides interpretable projections for future planning.  

üìå These techniques are valuable for **retail demand forecasting, sales strategy, and inventory management**.
